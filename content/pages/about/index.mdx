Hello, I'm Abiha Batool, a communication designer and city planner. My fascination with cities and the communities that breathe life into them has been the driving force behind my career. With a unique blend of expertise in design, planning, journalism, photography, and policy, I have dedicated myself to studying Karachi.
My city Karachi is one of the largest and least livable cities in the world, and is also the only city of its size that lacks a waste management system. My academic journey and professional endeavors have been centered around devising innovative solutions to this crisis. My aim is to implement a comprehensive, city-wide waste management system keeping in mind the people and the context of the problem. Through my work, I strive to create a more sustainable, livable, and vibrant Karachi one day.
