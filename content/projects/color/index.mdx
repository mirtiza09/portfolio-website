Company: Smart Sea Level Sensors

Project Overview: Many working-class communities in Savannah are vulnerable to climatic catastrophes like flooding and rains. These communities consisting of minorities have been neglected by the government for long periods. Smart Sea Level Sensors, a start-up funded by the government, aimed to address flooding on the east coast of the USA. They collected data and identified communities within Savannah that were most vulnerable and in need of help.

My Role: Community Engagement Lead

Tools Used:
* HMW (How Might We) Workshops
* Design Thinking Framework
* Primary and Secondary Research (literature review and ethnographic research)

Process: As an international student with no prior context about the place and people, I collaborated with a local NGO that introduced me to the communities. I spent time with two of the oldest communities in Savannah namely the Pinpoint and the Woodville, to learn about their lives, issues, and gain their trust. After building a rapport, I conducted multiple design thinking workshops separately with each community to help them identify how they would like to be helped to become climate resilient.

Outcome: The communities realized the importance of investing in their strength and independence. Some of the recommendations the communities made for fund utilization were to:
* Establish community centers and provide funding for community strengthening activities
* Build better schools and provide access to the internet for children to ensure quality education and self-sufficiency
* Establish grocery stores to gain access to quality food
By focusing on these areas, the communities aimed to develop their own capacity and build a climate-resilient system, reducing their reliance on government aid during climatic catastrophes.
