Project Title: Enhancing Customer and Staff Experience at Hussaini Blood Bank and Labs
Date and Timeline: - February 2021 - September 2021
Company: Designt (Experience Design Consultancy)
Team Size: Four service designers
My Role: Experience Designer
Project Overview: Hussaini Blood Bank, one of the largest blood banks in Asia, was experiencing a decline in its reputation. Customers were not choosing it as their preferred blood bank, and both staff and customer experiences were subpar. Designist, an experience design consultancy, was tasked with redesigning the customer and staff experience for the blood bank and its lab services.
Process: The project began with primary research, which included a Service Safari where I, along with three other team members had blood samples drawn from various blood banks and labs across Karachi. This helped us understand the landscape of blood banking in the region. We then visited over 30 branches of Hussaini Blood Bank, where I was involved in conducting interviews with staff, and also shadowed them to learn about their everyday routine. We then created detailed customer journeys, biocost maps, stakeholder personas and other documents, which helped us identify gaps in the existing experience in terms of technology, management, staff attitude, marketing and payrolls. We then held workshops, both in person and online, where solutions to these issues were brainstormed by these stakeholders.
Outcome: The final deliverable was a comprehensive report outlining recommendations for an ideal customer and staff journey. These recommendations included specific changes to improve the overall experience at Hussaini Blood Bank.  The recommended changes included:
Ensure each branch has access to quality internet.
Upgrade software to enhance the staff experience and enable digital data updates instead of relying on paper records.
Improve lab report design for better readability.
Provide staff training.
Boost social media presence to market competitive pricing and quality services.
Introduction of home services, and so on.
Many of these recommendations were implemented by the blood bank, resulting in a significant enhancement in both customer satisfaction and staff efficiency
